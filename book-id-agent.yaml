    - Year
    - Publisher - include city and country if available
    - Blurb - write a short description of the book appropriate to selling the book on ebay
    - Conditon - make brief notes on condition 50 words or less
    - Details: write a detailed list in bulleted format for a thorough list of information a book collector would appreciate, here
